# Oarsapp
Multipurpose android app for IITK students

This app is for IITK students. They can sign in on their Oars profile through this app and can generate exam schedule, timetable, transcript. You can even save your tmetable in your calendar app. 

For scrapping and mining we have used python libraries like BeautifulSou, mechanize, urllib, etc.

Right now app is not completed. It still has to be linked with php links.
